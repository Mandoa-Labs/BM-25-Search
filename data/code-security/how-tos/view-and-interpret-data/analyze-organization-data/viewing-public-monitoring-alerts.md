## About the public monitoring page

The **Public monitoring** page is a dedicated view within the enterprise-level security overview. It displays alerts for secrets detected in public repositories across GitHub that are attributed to your enterprise members or users with an email matching your enterprise's verified domain.

> \[!NOTE]
> The Public monitoring page is available at the enterprise level only. It is not available at the organization level.

## Prerequisites

Public monitoring must be enabled for your enterprise. See [Enabling public monitoring for your enterprise](/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-at-scale/configure-enterprise-security/manage-your-coverage/enabling-public-monitoring-for-your-enterprise).
